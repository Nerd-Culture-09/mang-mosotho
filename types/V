I wonder

I wonder what it would be like
I wonder how it would have felt
If you were here
If I never left
Funny how i thought I was over you
Funny how I believed it
But at every love song, you are
But at every romance movie, you are
Were we ever meant to be?
Were we really compatible?
Your touch
Your soft skin
As aggressive as you are
As gentle as one can be
Looking deep into your eyes
Looking at myself in you
Racing heart at a thought of you
Racing to decent when i am with you
Saturday, I used to mable
Saturday, I engraved you into my soul
We started as a fling
We never saw what could be possible
I guess we loved running around
I think we are sneaky that way
You made me feel alive
You make me feel alive
Have we moved on?
Have we lost it all?
I still look into your eyes
I still freeze
I saw you look at me
I saw you freeze
We are blinded by pain
We were blinded by love
The passion burns deep inside you
The silence in your eyes ignite the flames
I wonder what's possible
I wonder what fate has to say about us
